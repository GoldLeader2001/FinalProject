# FinalProject
COP4655 Final Project JohnSalsinger

Cryptocurrency tracker app using CoinMarketCap API for specific information
Cryptocurrency news provided by Gnews (google News API filtered for crypto specific articles)
Firebase auth and google sign in for authentification and user profiles.

App will automatically request a sign in upon first opening. New users will create a new account through firebase or use their google account to sign in
Once signed in app will open up to the home page which will show a list view of crypto information and a dynamic search bar to filter the list.
Users can then use the bottom nav bar to travel to either the news page or the profile page.
The News page just displays the most recent crypto news articles provided by Gnews (the app only shows a title, image, description, and link for the article)
The user profile page only shows the users image(which is unchangable at this release) and the users email.

installation will be through firebase distribution (link coming soon): https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/067fdf7f56f11c9c
